# Blueprint
A new open-source tool to rapidly generate multiple Laravel components using an expressive, human readable syntax.

Follow along with the development of Blueprint by [watching live streams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmwAMIdrAmK5q0c0JUqzW3u9tb0AqW95w) or [reviewing issues](https://github.com/laravel-shift/blueprint/issues).

_**v0.1 Tagged**: A beta release of Blueprint is now available which supports generating components using `models` definitions._


## Installation

To use Blueprint, you need a Laravel app:

```sh
laravel new APP_NAME
```

You can install this package via composer using this command:

```sh
cd APP_NAME
composer require --dev laravel-shift/blueprint
```

The package will automatically register itself.


## Usage
Blueprint adds an artisan command.

```sh
php artisan blueprint:build [draft]

```

The `draft` file contains your definition of the components to generate. By default, the `blueprint:build` command tries to load a `draft.yaml` file.
